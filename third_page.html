        <p><b>Chemical Contaminants:</b> DhM can absorb and transport harmful chemicals from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and urban pollution. The presence of pesticides, heavy metals (like mercury and lead), and other toxins in water can pose serious health risks to anyone who comes into contact with it or consumes it. Long-term exposure to contaminated water can lead to chronic health issues like cancer, developmental delays in children, and neurological problems. As DHM circulates these toxins, the risk of exposure increases, affecting both human populations and wildlife.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <div>
        <p class="flow-text"><b>Pathogens and Disease:</b> DhM is also capable of transporting harmful pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, that can contaminate water sources. Contaminated water can lead to waterborne diseases like cholera, dysentery, and giardia, which can cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in extreme cases, death. In regions where DhM is present in large quantities, the increased spread of these pathogens puts entire communities at risk. With inadequate sanitation and water treatment infrastructure, the impact of these waterborne diseases can be devastating, especially in vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    
    <div>
        <p class="flow-text"> <b>Algal Blooms:</b>DhM can also facilitate the spread of harmful algal blooms (HABs), which occur when certain algae grow uncontrollably in nutrient-rich waters, often fueled by excess nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural runoff. These blooms can produce toxins that are dangerous to both marine life and humans. Fish and shellfish that ingest these toxins can become poisonous to people who consume them, causing symptoms ranging from nausea and dizziness to paralysis or even death. Furthermore, the depletion of oxygen in the water caused by these blooms can lead to "dead zones," where marine life struggles to survive. DhM plays a key role in spreading these blooms across wider areas, increasing the frequency and severity of these environmental and public health threats.</p>
